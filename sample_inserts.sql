('heart attack', 'internal medicine', 'A heart attack, or myocardial infarction, happens when a coronary artery becomes blocked, reducing or stopping blood flow to a part of the heart muscle, causing it to become damaged or die. The patient typically experiences severe chest pain or discomfort that may radiate to the arm, neck, jaw, or back, along with shortness of breath, nausea, sweating, and lightheadedness. Upon examination, we might find the patient with cool, clammy skin, chest pain that worsens with exertion, labored or rapid breathing, oxygen saturation below normal levels, and ECG changes such as ST-segment elevation or depression, T-wave inversion, or new-onset left bundle branch block.'),
('major trauma', 'trauma', 'Major trauma refers to severe physical injuries sustained from high-energy events such as high-speed vehicle collisions, falls from significant heights, or penetrating injuries like gunshot or stab wounds, requiring immediate and specialized care. Typical signs include altered mental status, severe injuries such as open fractures or penetrating wounds, uncontrolled bleeding, and symptoms of shock, including pale or cool skin, rapid pulse, or low blood pressure. Examination may reveal decreased consciousness, labored or irregular breathing, low oxygen saturation, hypotension, weak or absent pulses, and multiple trauma indicators, such as chest or abdominal tenderness, pelvic instability, or fractures.');

('heart attack', 'The general management of a heart attack by a paramedic on scene includes performing a physical examination, taking the patient''s medical and pharmacological history, and measuring vital signs, including performing an ECG, which must be transmitted to an Emergency Medical Service (EMS) doctor for consultation. If advised by the EMS doctor, the paramedic must then consult with a doctor at the nearest or local cardiac center (a primary coronary intervention physician) to determine the appropriate treatment plan. The paramedic must administer medications as directed by the doctors, including Kardegic 500 mg intravenously, sufentanil for pain management, and heparin 1000 IU per 10 kg, but must confirm any hospital doctor''s orders with a follow-up call to the EMS doctor before administration.','https://www.heart.org/-/media/Files/Affiliates/MWA/North-Dakota/North-Dakota-Stroke-Cardiac-Conference/Cardiac-Indications-in-EMS.pdf'),
('major trauma', 'General management of a major trauma patient involves the crew performing a physical examination, taking into account the mechanism of injury and the energy involved, especially in cases of high-energy mechanisms of injury. The crew must approach the patient using the XABCDE algorithm and quickly determine whether the patient is trauma triage positive. If the patient is trauma triage positive, a Helicopter Emergency Medical Service (HEMS) may be called to the scene, though they may or may not be available. The patient must then be prepared for transport, which involves stabilizing their condition, such as stopping any bleeding, fully immobilizing the body, and transporting them to the nearest trauma center. The crew should ideally spend no more than ten minutes on scene, and the patient should be in the hospital within an hour of the injury.', 'https://emcmedicaltraining.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/phtls-9th-edition-prep-packets-2019a.pdf'),
